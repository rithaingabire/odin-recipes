    <h1 class="header">Agatogo recipe</h1>
    <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
        <li>large onion, chopped</li>
        <li> cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>oz can tomato paste</li>
        <li> mostly green plantains</li>
        <li>cups of thinly sliced, loosely packed collard greens (about 1/3 of a bunch)</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable broth (or water)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup peanuts, measured then ground
            oil and salt</li>

    </ul>
    <p><b>Instructions</b></p>
    <ol>
       <li> First, let’s figure out how to peel a green plantain. The skin sticks firmly to the flesh, so I recommend cutting the plantain in hunks, then slitting along the side one time.<br> This will make it easier to crack the peel back (sometimes I need to use a paring knife to help if the plantain is really green.</li>
<li>Next, fry the onion some vegetable oil until soft, then add in the garlic and continue cooking until the onions are just beginning to color. Add on the tomato paste, give a good stir, then toss on the plantains, greens, and mix with the vegetable broth. Add salt to taste (locals recommend using lots of salt, since the plantains absorb quite a bit). Let simmer uncovered for about 30 minutes, or until the plantains are tender and no longer white. Then sprinkle on the crushed peanuts.</li>
<li>If you’d like the stew thinner you can add some more broth or water, until you find the ideal consistency.</li>
<li>Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
